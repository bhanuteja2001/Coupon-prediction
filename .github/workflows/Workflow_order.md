1. CD-Deploy Workflow (First file):

This workflow is for Continuous Deployment (CD). Its main purpose is to automatically deploy changes to your production environment when code is pushed to the 'develop' branch.

Key actions:
- Triggered on push to 'develop' branch
- Sets up AWS credentials and Terraform
- Plans and applies Terraform changes to set up or update infrastructure
- Retrieves and syncs model artifacts from development to production

This workflow ensures that your infrastructure is updated and new model versions are deployed automatically when changes are pushed to the develop branch.

2. CI-Tests Workflow (Second file):

This workflow is for Continuous Integration (CI). Its main purpose is to run tests and checks on your code when a pull request is made to the 'develop' branch.

Key actions:
- Triggered on pull requests to 'develop' branch
- Sets up Python environment
- Installs project dependencies
- Runs unit tests
- Performs linting
- Validates Terraform configuration (plan stage)

This workflow helps ensure code quality and catch potential issues before changes are merged into the develop branch.

The relationship between these workflows:

- The CI-Tests workflow runs when a pull request is opened or updated. It helps validate the changes before they are merged.
- Once the pull request is approved and merged, triggering a push to the 'develop' branch, the CD-Deploy workflow kicks in to deploy these changes.

This setup creates a pipeline where:
1. Developers open pull requests with their changes
2. The CI workflow automatically tests these changes
3. After review and approval, changes are merged
4. The CD workflow automatically deploys the approved and tested changes

This separation of CI and CD allows for a robust process of validating changes before they're merged, and then automatically deploying them once they're approved, enhancing both code quality and deployment efficiency.
